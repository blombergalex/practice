Small Group Sizes 

Our kitesurf lessons are run in small groups with a student to instructor ratio of 1:1 or 2:1. This way, your qualified kitesurfing instructor can tailor the kitesurfing lessons to your individual learning needs. 

 

Quality and Easy-To-Use Gear 

Step-by-step instructions and the latest Naish and Ozone kiteboarding equipment will ensure you progress easily and safely while learning this addictive sport! The use of all kitesurfing gear, impact vests and helmets is included in our lesson price.

Once you have completed our 2-Day kitesurfing course, you might want to purchase your own kitesurfing equipment. We are here to help you to find the right gear, and are offering a $300 lesson voucher with every kitesurfing equipment package purchased.

Great Lesson Locations 

With no crowds and flat and shallow waters, we are teaching at kitesurfing locations, which provide excellent learning conditions. Being a fully mobile kitesurfing school means that we will be at the best location for the conditions.

"My instructor gave me exactly the right piece of advice to get me to the next level. All the gear we used was less than a year old and in great condition. After my lessons they also helped me purchase my first set of kite gear." Chris
