    <p>"Incredibly fun controlled and reassuring instructor- super flexible management team!" Jess</p>
    <p>"My instructor gave me exactly the right piece of advice to get me to the next level. All the gear we used was less than a year old and in great condition. After my lessons they also helped me purchase my first set of kite gear." Chris </p>
